### Explanation  
*I use this all the time. People have been asking me to share, so here it is. 
- This is based off of regular finger spelling.  The difference is that you slide your hand over ever so slightly to the -TZ and add that on the end. 
- Everybody is capable of moving their hand over when there are no other keys being pressed on the right side.  So give it a try even if you think it's impossible. ====Nothing is impossible with practice. ====
- I do have a regular finger-spelling dictionary, but I also have entered just one letter entries like A, which would be ATZ. 
- TATZ would be TA 
- TPHRA would be FLA 
- TKPWHROU is GROU 
- If the -TZ conflicts with anything, try a different combo of letters that you would never stroke. -TDZ might even be easier for you. 

#### Reversing Letters 
- I am using the asterisk to reverse the letters. 
- I have some entries that have three letters, and those do not get reversed. 

#### Anomalies 
- I have left out KW- as a combo and made that Q.  
- Instead of KH-, I made that CH. 
- Instead of KL-, I made that CL.
- Instead of AOI, I made that Y.
- Instead of KP-, I made that CP.
 
*NOTE:  I use SKP- for X and SWR- for Z.*  


#### The Extra Entries 
-  Some of these entries may seem a little silly as they fall outside of usual spelling rules, but you'd be surprised how handy they are when you are hearing lots of acronyms. 

#### How to Get In Your CAT Software 
- CATalyst users, you can import this file just like you would any other .rtf file.  The formatting will be correct.
- Other software users, same thing.
