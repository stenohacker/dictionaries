### Finger Spell With More Than One Letter!?!?

- I use this all the time. People have been asking me to share, so here it is. 
- This is based off of regular finger spelling.  The difference is that you slide your hand over ever so slightly to the -TZ and add that on the end. 
- I am using the asterisk to reverse the letters. 
- I have some entries that are three letters, and those do not get reversed. 
-  Some of these entries may seem a little silly as they fall outside of usual spelling rules, but you'd be surprised how handy they are when you are hearing lots of acronyms. 
- CATalyst users, you can import this file just like you would any other .rtf file. 
- Other software users, same thing.
